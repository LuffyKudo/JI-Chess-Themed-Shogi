# JI Chess-Themed Shogi

[Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi) (Japanese Chess) is the Japanese cousin of western chess and now you can play shogi using chess pieces and board on 81Dojo and Lishogi.org!

## Feature
- Choose between four Kings Style:
  - Gyoku-Ou (Sente has the Jewel while Gote has the King)[_default_]
  - Ou-Gyoku (Sente has the King while Gote has the Jewel)
  - Double Gyoku (both have the Jewels)
  - Double Ou (both have the Kings)

### Features on 81Dojo
Due to the nature of 81Dojo's coding where upright pieces are always named sente even when the board is rotated or even if you are playing gote, the black pieces for this theme will always start at the bottom. Thus a new configuration was added where you can choose the color of the piece at the bottom of the board (e.g., you can select White if you are playing gote).

***\*Note:** 81Dojo already has the correct distinction between Gyoku and Ou (Jewel and King), which is Ou for the higher rated/ranked player, so the default “Gyoku-Ou” should be selected for the Kings Style. However, for loaded external kifus, it seems like sente always has the gyoku, so you have the freedom to select the Kings Style depending on the ranking and your preference.*
